# Coding Conventions

- Use functional components and hooks.
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.
- Prefer `framer-motion` for complex animations.

## Naming
- Components should be PascalCase.
- Utility functions and variables should be camelCase.
- Files should match component names.

## Structure
- Keep UI components in `components/ui`.
- Keep business logic or complex layouts in `components`.
- Use `data/` for static data or mock data.
